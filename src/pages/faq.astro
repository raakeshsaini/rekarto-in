  {
    q: "What is ReKarto City Partner program?",
    a: "It is a city-level offline thrift distribution partnership where you operate as the authorized buyer and seller for your city under ReKarto’s supply system.",
  },
  {
    q: "What type of inventory does ReKarto supply?",
    a: "We supply graded surplus and thrift inventory sourced from organized channels. The focus is resale-ready stock suitable for offline distribution, not random liquidation lots.",
  },
  {
  q: "What is the ReKarto City Partner program?",
  a: "It is a city-level offline thrift and surplus distribution partnership where you operate as the authorized buyer and seller for your city under ReKarto’s centralized supply system.",
},

{
  q: "Who is this program designed for?",
  a: "This program is designed for serious offline operators with physical space who want predictable supply, fixed pricing, and long-term business stability. It is not meant for online-only sellers or casual resellers.",
},

{
  q: "Do you sell retail or small quantities?",
  a: "No. ReKarto does not sell retail or small quantities. We supply only to approved City Partners, who then serve local retailers and micro resellers in their city.",
},

{
  q: "Is credit or post-paid buying allowed?",
  a: "No. All purchases are strictly prepaid. Credit-based buying creates instability and is not part of the ReKarto operating model.",
},

{
  q: "Is online or Instagram reselling allowed?",
  a: "No. The City Partner model is strictly offline-first. Partners are expected to sell through physical channels and local resale networks.",
},

{
  q: "Do you offer a dead stock guarantee?",
  a: "ReKarto does not offer open buybacks or cash refunds. However, active City Partners are eligible for a controlled stock-rotation system if certain stock does not move after a defined holding period.",
},

{
  q: "What is the stock-rotation system?",
  a: "Stock rotation allows limited exchange of select unsold B or C grade items into other categories through a credit-based adjustment. This is designed to protect operators during learning phases, not to replace selling discipline.",
},

{
  q: "Is stock rotation available on all products?",
  a: "No. Stock rotation is never available on A-grade fast movers and is applicable only on select B and C grade stockks, subject to condition checks and eligibility rules.",
},

{
  q: "After how long can stock rotation be requested?",
  a: "Stock rotation may be requested only after a minimum holding period, typically between 60 to 90 days, and only if monthly purchase discipline is maintained.",
},

{
  q: "Is stock rotation a refund?",
  a: "No. Stock rotation is not a refund. No cash is returned. Approved rotation is adjusted as credit against future orders.",
},

{
  q: "How much stock can be rotated?",
  a: "Rotation is strictly capped and limited to a small percentage of recent purchases. Exact limits depend on partner performance and are shared privately after approval.",
},

{
  q: "What happens if the rotation system is misused?",
  a: "Misuse results in immediate loss of rotation privilege and may lead to suspension of other partner benefits or termination of the partnership.",
},

{
  q: "Do all partners need to use stock rotation?",
  a: "No. Most successful partners rarely need rotation once local demand is understood. The system exists as protection, not dependency.",
},

{
  q: "What other benefits do City Partners receive?",
  a: "City Partners receive territory clarity, demand routing from micro partners, access to private inventory drops, optional city-level website presence, and long-term supply stability.",
},

{
  q: "How do I apply for the City Partner program?",
  a: "You can apply through the application form on rekarto.in. All applications are manually reviewed, and most applications are rejected by design.",
},

  {
    q: "Do I need prior thrift or retail experience?",
    a: "No. The system is designed for disciplined execution, not prior retail expertise. However, basic local market understanding is required.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this an online or offline business?",
    a: "Primarily offline. Online resale is optional and only recommended after stable offline operations.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much investment is required?",
    a: "Investment varies by city and scale. Exact numbers are discussed only after application review to avoid mismatched expectations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does ReKarto guarantee profits?",
    a: "No. ReKarto provides a structured supply and distribution system. Execution discipline determines outcomes.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there exclusivity for a city?",
    a: "Yes. Only one active City Partner per city is allowed at a time, subject to performance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kind of inventory is supplied?",
    a: "Graded thrift inventory sourced from liquidation, exports, and organized channels — not random street sourcing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I run this part-time?",
    a: "No. This model requires active involvement, especially in the first 6–12 months.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I apply?",
    a: "You can apply via the Apply page. Shortlisted applicants are contacted for the next steps.",
  },
