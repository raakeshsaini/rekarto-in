## What is ReKarto City Partner program?
It is a city-level offline thrift distribution partnership where you operate as the authorized buyer and seller for your city.

## Do I need prior thrift or retail experience?
No. The system is designed for disciplined execution, not prior retail expertise. However, basic local market understanding is required.

## Is this an online or offline business?
Primarily offline. Online resale is optional and only recommended after stable offline operations.

## How much investment is required?
Investment varies by city and scale. Exact numbers are discussed only after application review to avoid mismatched expectations.

## Does ReKarto guarantee profits?
No. ReKarto provides a structured supply and distribution system. Execution discipline determines outcomes.

## Is there exclusivity for a city?
Yes. Only one active City Partner per city is allowed at a time, subject to performance.

## What kind of inventory is supplied?
Graded thrift inventory sourced from liquidation, exports, and organized channels — not random street sourcing.

## Can I run this part-time?
No. This model requires active involvement, especially in the first 6–12 months.

## How do I apply?
You can apply via the Apply page. Shortlisted applicants are contacted for the next steps.
